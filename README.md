# Trip Prep Tracker (React + Vite + Tailwind)

A flashy trip-prep tracker with tabs, animations, sound effects, and a vibe gallery.

## Quick start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the printed URL (usually http://localhost:5173).

## Build & Preview

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Notes

- If you see a MetaMask error overlay: it is from a browser extension or host. The app ignores those errors so the UI keeps running.
- Data is stored in your browser's localStorage. Use **Export** and **Import** in the app header to save/restore.
